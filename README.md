# CS-330-Final-Project
- How do I approach designing software?

  Designing software can be a difficult task. What I like to do is first start out with what the requirements are. "Does the program need a menu?" "Is it supposed to do calculation?" Then, I like to go through each requirement and knock out the easier tasks first before moving on to tougher ones. Also making sure the code is easy-to-read by adding comments and putting some things into their own functions to keep the code clean. 

- What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
    
    When it comes to new design skills, OpenGL in general was a new design skill. In all seriousness though, applying textures and using lighting helped me to craft a cleaner-looking scene. Learning how to use texture helped me to make the objects more realistic and lighting helped me to make the objects "come to life" in a sense. 

- What design process did you follow for your project work?
  
  I followed mostly what I've always done by looking at the requirements and going through each task as I go. When it came to this project, I started by getting the easier bits done (title screen, functions, etc.) before I went onto harder tasks like creating a cylinder. Then, if I got a task done, I would see if there is any extra things to add like different texture or different light sources if there was time. Testing a lot was another thing I did like after each function I made, I made sure that nothing wasn't working. It helped too with debugging since I was able to figure out what worked and what didn't after each function was tested instead of getting to the end and having to figure why something wasn't working.

- How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
  
  These tactics will help in really any line of work. Taking things piece-by-piece instead of biting off big chunks all at once will be helpful for my future projects too. Testing frequently also is very helpful.

- How do I approach developing programs?

  When I develop programs, I like to incrementally add things and test as I go. I find that this reduces time if I write code in smaller pieces and test each piece after I make it instead of just coding the entire program and then testing. 

- What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?

  Adding texture and lighting were the new strategies I had to consider for my 3D scene. This is mainly because in other programs, I haven't had to think about lighting or what texture would fit best on an object based on a photo. I had to play around with a few different lighting sources to get the right "feel" for what my photo had. Adding textures was a pretty big development strategy since textures help "develop" the object further instead of just having an object with no color. 

- How did iteration factor into your development?

  Iteration helped me a lot with the development of my 3D scene. Interation is the repetition of instructions and in my 3D scene, I repeated many things over again like setting up the libraries, setting VAOS and VBOS up with objects, repeating the cylinder code for other objects other than the Dunkin bottle, etc. Iteration helped to get me to remember how to do things instead of going back and forth constantly to check if something was correct. 

- How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?

 My approach to developing code got better and better. I felt like I was adding more to the final project as I completed each milestone. In the beginning though, I was not very good at understanding what was expected on each milestone. But as each week passed, I found myself gettinf better at extracting requirements and making them simpler to deal with. 

- How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

 Computer science has always been a big motivator for me and reaching my end goals. Since I find video game development interesting, I could see how OpenGL would help with the creation of the graphics in a video game, whether it's 2D or 3D. I think this class has helped me to figure out what direction I want to go with computer science.
