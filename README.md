# CS-330-Final-Project
- How do I approach designing software?

  Designing software can be a difficult task. What I like to do is first start out with what the requirements are. "Does the program need a menu?" "Is it supposed to do calculation?" Then, I like to go through each requirement and knock out the easier tasks first before moving on to tougher ones. Also making sure the code is easy-to-read by adding comments and putting some things into their own functions to keep the code clean. 

- What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
    
    When it comes to new design skills, OpenGL in general was a new design skill. In all seriousness though, applying textures and using lighting helped me to craft a cleaner-looking scene. Learning how to use texture helped me to make the objects more realistic and lighting helped me to make the objects "come to life" in a sense. 

- What design process did you follow for your project work?
  
  I followed mostly what I've always done by looking at the requirements and going through each task as I go. When it came to this project, I started by getting the easier bits done (title screen, functions, etc.) before I went onto harder tasks like creating a cylinder. Then, if I got a task done, I would see if there is any extra things to add like different texture or different light sources if there was time. Testing a lot was another thing I did like after each function I made, I made sure that nothing wasn't working. It helped too with debugging since I was able to figure out what worked and what didn't after each function was tested instead of getting to the end and having to figure why something wasn't working.

- How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
  
  These tactics will help in really any line of work. Taking things piece-by-piece instead of biting off big chunks all at once will be helpful for my future projects too. Testing frequently also is very helpful.

- How do I approach developing programs?

  When I develop programs, I like to incrementally add things and test as I go. I find that this reduces time if I write code in smaller pieces and test each piece after I make it instead of just coding the entire program and then testing. 

- What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?

  Adding texture and lighting were the new strategies I had to consider for my 3D scene. This is mainly because in other programs, I haven't had to think about lighting or what texture would fit best on an object based on a photo. I had to play around with a few different lighting sources to get the right "feel" for what my photo had.
